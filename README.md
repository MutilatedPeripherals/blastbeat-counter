## Plan

[X] Identify frequencies of snare & bass drum (hihat for next iteration)

- snare: 300hz
- bass drum: 60hz
  [X] Process the waveform (0.5s segments) and determine: 1) does it contain snare, 2) does it contain bass drum
- [] If at least 4 consecutive segments contain snare and bass drum, count it as a blast beat
- [] Plot the waveform (and spectrogram) with the blast beat segments highlighted
